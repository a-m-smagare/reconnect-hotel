# Reconnect-hotel

This Nature Hotel Webpage is a project I created to demonstrate my web development skills and understanding of modern frontend technologies. This project serves as a portfolio piece, demonstrating my ability to design, develop and deploy a responsive, interactive and visually appealing website. 

The webpage was built with the goal of highlighting my proficiency in frontend development, UI/UX design principles and utilizing core web technologies. Below are the tools and techniques I used:

- **HTML5, CSS3,** and **JavaScript** for building the core structure and interactivity of my project.
- **Responsive Design** to optimize the page for various screen sizes.
- **Dynamic content rendering, form validation** and **smooth transitions** to enhance user experience.
- The development process was managed with **Git** for version control and **GitHub Pages** for deployment.

Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to take a concept from design to deployment, incorporating skills such as wireframing, coding, debugging and hosting.

## Development Approach
The webpage was built entirely from scratch. By avoiding frameworks, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to create a fully functional, responsive website using core web development technologies, to demonstrate my understanding of DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering. Highlight my attention to detail and problem-solving skills without relying on external libraries.

## Features
- **Interactive booking form** for check-in/check-out dates and room selection.
- **Animated Gallery section** with images showcasing the hotel rooms.
- **Contact form** for inquiries.
- **Clickable email link** in the footer, opening the users default email client.
- **Google Maps Integration** in the footer, opening the hotels address in Google Maps fr easier navigation.

## Technologies Used
